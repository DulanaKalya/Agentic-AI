Beyond serving as human assistants, they are being programmed to be agents themselves — negotiating contracts, making decisions, exploring legal arguments, and so on. [...] “We are already well into the Agentic Age [of AI],” Aral said. “Companies are developing and deploying autonomous, multimodal AI agents in a vast array of tasks. But our understanding of how to work with AI agents to maximize productivity and performance, as well as the societal implications of this dramatic turn toward agentic AI, is nascent, if not nonexistent.
